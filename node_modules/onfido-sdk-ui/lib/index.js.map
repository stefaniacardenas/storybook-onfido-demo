some devices (namely iOS Safari) have issues with calling\n      `getUserMedia` multiple times from cold (i.e. without any existing streams\n      already running in the background), so we don't stop the stream for\n      `stopDelay` milliseconds, in an attempt to re-use the same stream, if a new\n      component is mounted soon after.\n      This issue of iOS Safari was pinpointed by unmounting and remounting the\n      webcam component multiple times, and confirming that the error occurred in\n      the `getUserMedia` request - and then testing that the error did _not_ occur\n      if we never called `.stop()` on the tracks (however we do need to relinquish\n      the stream eventually)\n      The precise value for `stopDelay` is a finger-in-the-air value, that is\n      a nice balance between the stream being relinquished (so the webcam light\n      turns off etc.), and the crash not occuring (because of the wait)\n      */\n\n\n      var stopDelay = 1000;\n\n      __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__babel_runtime_corejs3_core_js_stable_set_timeout___default()(function () {\n        return stopStreamTracks(_this2.stream);\n      }, stopDelay);\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"getScreenshot\",\n    value: function getScreenshot() {\n      var canvas = this.getCanvas();\n      if (!canvas) return null;\n      return canvas.toDataURL(this.props.screenshotFormat);\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"getCanvas\",\n    value: function getCanvas() {\n      var _context6;\n\n      if (!this.state.hasUserMedia || !this.video) return null;\n      var video = this.video;\n      if (!this.canvas) this.canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n      var canvas = this.canvas;\n      if (!this.ctx) this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n      var ctx = this.ctx; // This is set every time incase the video element has resized\n\n      canvas.width = video.videoWidth;\n      canvas.height = video.videoHeight;\n      ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n      debugConsole(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__babel_runtime_corejs3_core_js_stable_instance_concat___default()(_context6 = \"drawn image to canvas: \".concat(canvas.width, \"x\")).call(_context6, canvas.height));\n      return canvas;\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"startRecording\",\n    value: function startRecording() {\n      this.mediaRecorder = Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_18__video__[\"a\" /* createMediaRecorder */])(this.stream);\n      this.recordedBlobs = Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_18__video__[\"b\" /* startRecording */])(this.mediaRecorder);\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"stopRecording\",\n    value: function stopRecording() {\n      this.mediaRecorder.stop(this.recordedBlobs);\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"getVideoBlob\",\n    value: function getVideoBlob() {\n      var mimeType = this.mediaRecorder.mimeType;\n      var type = mimeType.split(';')[0]; // mimeType (excluding the codec)\n\n      return new Blob(this.recordedBlobs, {\n        type: type\n      });\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"render\",\n    value: function render() {\n      var _this3 = this;\n\n      // React will try and optimise this on re-mounts, so make sure to explicitly\n      // not render with a stream that no longer exists\n      // This is likely related to https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui/blob/249f54264f3a1674a2702b95967bb91ec6e3b90d/src/components/Confirm/index.js#L37\n      // as the `video` element should not _should_ not show anything if the stream\n      // is `null` anyway\n      if (!this.stream) return null;\n      return __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_17_react___default.a.createElement(\"video\", {\n        style: {\n          // not necessary to add prefixes, since all browsers that support camera\n          // support transform\n          transform: this.state.mirrored ?

user changing their browser font size.\\n * At the same time, `px` is a unit often used in templates etc. from Design.\\n * To accommodate for both of these cases, we make our @unit be 1/16 of an `em`.\\n * This results in each @unit into being the same as 1px (when the parent\\n * font-size is 16px, as it is by default).\\n *\\n * So each \\\"unit\\\" isn't a pixel, but it is when the parent font size is 16px,\\n * and it's proportionate to the difference otherwise.\\n */\\n/*\\n * We also need different units for when trying to do `px` \\\"equivalents\\\" when\\n * our parent has a different font size.\\n */\\n/*\\n * We also have a special unit for the react-phone-number-input library, so\\n * we can keep its units in line with whatever units we decide to pick\\n */\\n/* Solid
